  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
fonts:
  - family: BebasNeue-Regular
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf
      - weight: 800
  - family: Oxanium
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Oxanium-VariableFont_wght.ttf
      - weight: 800
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
